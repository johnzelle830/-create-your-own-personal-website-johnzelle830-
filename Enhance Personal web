<h1>Johnzelle Bush Intro</h1>
<p> Hello my name is Johnzelle Bush and i will be giving a brief summary about me.</p>
<h2> Favorite hobby and interest
<p>Basketball is my favorite hobby for a multitude of reasons. The exhilaration of dribbling down the court, the precision required to sink a three-pointer, and the teamwork involved
in executing a flawless pick-and-roll all contribute to my love for the sport. Whether I'm playing with friends at the local court or watching a professional game, basketball never fails to
captivate me. The physicality of the game keeps me active and engaged, while the strategic aspect challenges my mind. Overall, basketball is more than just a hobby to meâ€”it's a passion
that brings me joy and fulfillment.</p>
