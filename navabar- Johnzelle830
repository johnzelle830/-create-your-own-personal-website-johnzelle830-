<h1> Hello My name is Johnzelle Bush </h1>
  <img src="data:/jpeg:base64.jpg">
<p>I am a passionate basketball player with a deep love for the game. From a young age, I have dedicated countless hours to honing my skills on the court, developing my technique, and studying the strategies of the game. Basketball has taught me the value of discipline, teamwork, and perseverance, shaping me into the individual I am today. Whether I am shooting hoops with friends for fun or competing in a high-stakes game, the thrill of the sport never fails to excite me. As I continue to push myself to improve and reach new heights in my basketball journey, I am grateful for the lessons and memories that the game has brought into my life.</p>
